                                             We use data visualization to provide volcano lovers some useful analysis,

                                             distribution of volcanoes in the world. Our target audience are the people who are interested 
                                             in learning some basic knowledge of volcanoes or geographic detections. 
                                             Since we include data about the types of volcanoes, population near the volcanoes, 
                                             and elevation of volcanoes in various regions, we hope we can provide the audience

                                  the next year. The Volcanoes eruption table shows this pattern."),

                                  loses. For example, we can see that the ratio of duration of volcanoes' eruption months change from
                                  month to month, than we can expect a different plan towards volcanoes that erupt in different months.
                                  Our eruption data is relatively reliable because it contains 11.2k rows of volcanoes data, it gives
                                  unbiased result because it came from more that sources. There might be some bias because of unreliable
                                  evidence source, but only a pretty few amount of volcanoes evidence in our eruptions dataset is from
