      We use data visualization to provide volcano lovers some useful analysis, 
      such as helping them understand and predict the eruption of volcanoes and the 
      distribution of volcanoes in the world. Our target audience are the people who are interested 
      in learning some basic knowledge of volcanoes or geographic detections. 
      Since we include data about the types of volcanoes, population near the volcanoes, 
      and elevation of volcanoes in various regions, we hope we can provide the audience 
      a sight of the basic knowledge of volcanoes and the relationship between volcanoes and people.
